# MIDI-feature-extraction
In this repository the project files can be found that were used for the Text and Multimedia Project paper.

In the folder `scripts`, several scripts can be found:
- `midi-feature-extraction.ipynb`: This file was used to set up to extract the features from the MIDI files available, which writes the features to a .csv file.
- `feature-analysis.ipynb`: This file was used to analyse the extracted features.
- `midi-playground-analysis.ipynb`: This file was used to extract some basic knowledge from a single MIDI sample as a try-out.

In the folder `data` the map with the used MIDI files can be found.

All of the scripts were ran on Kaggle.com

_Note:_ path variables in the scripts might be different from current structure.
